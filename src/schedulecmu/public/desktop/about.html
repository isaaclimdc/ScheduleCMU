				<h4 id="aboutus">What is ScheduleCMU?</h4>
				<p>This paper is a proposal to create a cross platform mobile web app. Current course scheduling tools at CMU are not a fully integrated solution. This web app will streamline the process of creating schedules for students in the CMU community, by making their respective course requirements and options more easily accessible. This proposal gives an overview of our plan to achieve this project including a description of our basic approach and our project schedule.</p>

				<h4 id="mission">Our Mission</h4>
				<p>Mobile devices, more specifically smartphones, are ubiquitous nowadays, and typically serve as one’s secondary computer. However, mobile web browsers do not have all the features of a desktop web browser and often webpages are not rendered in a pleasing or functional format. We aim to develop an app that allows schedules to be created and viewed as easily on your mobile device as on your computer.</p>
				<p>Furthermore, current schedule creation tools at CMU like Student Information Online (SIO) and ScheduleMan do not contain features to allow easy access to major and minor course requirements. This leads to the hassle of having to switch back and forth between multiple tabs on your computer to see whether courses you intend to take meet your major or minor requirements. Our app aims to be self-contained by creating an interface to incorporate the course requirements and electives for majors and minors in an efficient manner and possibly provide options to satisfy multiple requirements with a single course or series of courses. We will thus dispense with the need to look at multiple different applications in order to create a class schedule.</p>
				<h4 id="team">Our Team</h4>
				<p>We are all Sophomore Computer Science majors with varying talents and skills. Each of us have past internships in Software Engineering and/or Design. We have all completed the core Computer Science curriculum expected of a third-semester student at Carnegie Mellon.</p>
				<!-- Add headshots for each of us and a blurb about our mad skills yo -->
				<!-- include links to Maddie and Isaacs portfolio websites -->
				<h4 id="story">Our Story</h4>
				<p>On the implementation front, this project will span two design phases, a rapid development phase, and a user testing phase. The first design phase will involve drafting wireframes of ScheduleCMU’s user interface This will allow us to determine which features are most important for a great user experience. In the second design phase, we will outline the structure and interactions of the various components of the ScheduleCMU system. We will also specify the algorithms and design points relevant to developing each feature of the web application.</p>
				<p>After these design phases, we will proceed to the development phase. In order to make ScheduleCMU available to the public as quickly as possible, we will split up and delegate the development of different components and implement ScheduleCMU’s front (user interface) and back (server) ends simultaneously. At several intermediate milestones, we will merge the front and back ends and conduct minor unit tests, to make sure the product is robust and functional. </p>
				<p>Finally, once development is complete, we will open our application for testing with a limited group of people from the CMU community, and gather feedback in order to improve our application, and prepare ScheduleCMU for widespread use.</p>
