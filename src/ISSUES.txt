This is intended to be a comprehensive list of issues raised by users as
expressed in the survey, to the developers or on social media.

Outstanding issues are on top. Issues that have been dealt with are moved to the
bottom section with a comment on the version in which it was fixed or the reason
for not fixing it.

Developer comments on the outstanding issues can be made in parentheses with
developer initials after the comment.


OUTSTANDING ISSUES

1) Back button in course browser. Clicking the cross should exit instead of
functioning as a back button.

2) Even when a course is deleted immediately after adding, the input box says
"Course X added successfully" (This is an easy fix - just didn't want to mess
with the front-end code - NC)

2) No dates on the calendar, so course events are not utilized to their full
potential.

3) No logout.

4) Lack of multiple schedules.

5) Popup blocking (I'm not sure if this has been dealt with - NC)

6) Search by course name.


ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN DEALT WITH

2) Multiple classes in the same time period show up nicely - fixed in v1.1

3)
